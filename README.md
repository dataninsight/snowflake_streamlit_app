# snowflake_streamlit_app

This provides beginner-level exposure to key app builder tools like Streamlit, Python, GitHub, and Web Services Rest APIs. 
Though this workshop relies on a partner data integration tool to help us move data around, there are lots of new Snowflake concepts covered as well. We'll use an Internal Named Stage and come to understand how they differ from external stages. We'll install and use SnowSQL (Snowflake's CLI tool) to perform file PUTs.
